    					<p class = "project-text">For this annual package, I conducted a survey of more than 200 public universities, collected and analyzed the responses, and worked with our developer and another reporter to interpret the data and present it effectively in an interactive tool. I also wrote <a href = "http://chronicle.com/article/For-Many-Public-College/139187/">a story</a> about the uncalculated benefit of housing that many college presidents receive and that neither they nor their employers pay taxes on.

							<p class = "project-text">As a data journalist, I tell stories with Excel formulas and SQL queries just as often, if not more, than with words. But writing is my first passion and the skill that got me into journalism in the first place. Below are some of my favorite writing clips.</p>

Written shortly after the war, translated from the original Yiddish by my grandmother decades later, and brought to publication through the efforts of several family members, <em>Sky Tinged Red</em> was truly a multigenerational project. I wrote the foreword and afterword (which you'll have to buy the book to read, detailing my family's life before and after the Holocaust.

              <p class = "project-text">I can still remember my first film camera, an ugly rectangular hunk of plastic with nothing but a viewfinder and a shutter button. I walked around the house with it (usually there wasn't any film) taking photos of my family and stuffed animals. I've since graduated to a DSLR, but my desire to capture the world around me hasn't changed. To me, photography is not only my favorite art form, but also a powerful tool for engaging with the world around us and, of course, telling stories. Over the past several years I've added audio, video and even some HTML/CSS to my toolbox of multimedia storytelling.</p>

              <p class = "project-text">Children from lower-income families will hear, on average, 30-million fewer words by the time they turn four than their peers from high-income households. This vocabulary gap quickly turns into an achievement gap when these children enter school. This audio piece, about research that hopes to close the 30-million word gap, was produced with Lindsey Kratochwill for WBEZ's Front &amp; Center series on literacy in the Great Lakes region.
