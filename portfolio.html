          <p class = "project-text">The product of several months of FOIA requests and reporting, this story looked at Title IX, the federal civil-rights law increasingly being used by survivors of rape to try to hold their colleges accountable for mishandling investigations into sexual assault. Based on my analysis of the outcomes of Title IX sexual-violence complaints, we explored the reasons the law hasn't met students' high expectations of it. <em>With Libby Sander.</em></p>

In addition to reporting the compensation of presidents at the 500 wealthiest private colleges in the country, we provided comparisons to the salaries of professors and other key employees and to the university's overall budget. The EWA judges called it "definitive in scope, comprehensive, and well-executed." (Dec. 15, 2013)</p>

Written shortly after the war, translated from the original Yiddish by my grandmother decades later, and brought to publication through the efforts of several family members, <em>Sky Tinged Red</em> was truly a multigenerational project. This piece in <em>Tablet</em>, an online magazine of Jewish ideas and culture, details the story of how this important piece of personal and communal history was brought to light decades after my great-grandfather died. I also wrote the book's foreword and afterword (which you'll have to buy the book to read) detailing my family's life before and after the Holocaust. <a href = "http://www.skytingedred.com" target = "_blank">Click here</a> to learn more about the book, or <a href = "http://www.bookhousefulfillment.com/cart.php?m=product_detail&special=1&p=1200" target = "_blank">click here</a> to purchase it.

          <p class = "intro">I can still remember my first film camera, an ugly rectangular hunk of plastic with nothing but a viewfinder and a shutter button. I walked around the house with it (usually there wasn't any film) taking photos of my family and stuffed animals (I was probably 6 years old). I've since graduated to a DSLR, but my desire to tell stories visually hasn't changed. Over the past several years I've added audio, video and even some HTML/CSS (I built this website) to my toolbox of multimedia storytelling.</p>

            <p class = "project-text">Children from lower-income families will hear, on average, 30-million fewer words by the time they turn four than their peers from high-income households. This vocabulary gap quickly turns into an achievement gap when these children enter school. This audio piece, about research that hopes to close the 30-million word gap, was produced with Lindsey Kratochwill for WBEZ's Front &amp; Center series on literacy in the Great Lakes region.
