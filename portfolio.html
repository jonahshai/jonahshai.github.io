          <p class = "project-text">In August 1995, the first of the infamous high rises at the Henry Horner Homes public housing project on Chicago's Near West side began to come down. Twenty years later, Westhaven, a mixed-income housing development stands in its place. This story asks whether the social experiment is working and, more importantly, whom is it working for?

          <p class = "project-text">The product of several months of FOIA requests and reporting, this story looked at Title IX, the federal civil-rights law increasingly being used by survivors of rape to try to hold their colleges accountable for mishandling investigations into sexual assault. Based on my analysis of the outcomes of Title IX sexual-violence complaints, we explored the reasons the law hasn't met students' high expectations of it. <em>With Libby Sander</em>.

In addition to reporting the compensation of presidents at the 500 wealthiest private colleges in the country, we provided comparisons to the salaries of professors and other key employees and to the university's overall budget. The EWA judges called it "definitive in scope, comprehensive, and well-executed." (Dec. 15, 2013)</p>

    			<p class = "project-text">For this annual package on compensation, I sent public records requests to more than 200 public universities, collected and analyzed the responses, and worked with our developer and another reporter to interpret the data and present it effectively in an interactive tool. I also wrote <a href = "http://chronicle.com/article/For-Many-Public-College/139187/" target = "_blank">a story</a> about the uncalculated benefit of housing that many college presidents receive and that neither they nor their employers pay taxes on. This project was cited widely in both national and local press. (May 13, 2013)</p>

          <p class = "project-text">In April 2013, my family posthumously published my great-grandfather's chronicle of the two-and-a-half years he spent in Auschwitz-Birkenau, from April 1942 to November 1944. Written shortly after the war, translated from the original Yiddish by my grandmother decades later, and brought to publication through the efforts of several family members, <em>Sky Tinged Red</em> was truly a multigenerational project. This piece in <em>Tablet</em>, an online magazine of Jewish ideas and culture, details the story of how this important piece of personal and communal history was brought to light decades after my great-grandfather died. I also wrote the book's foreword and afterword (which you'll have to buy the book to read) detailing my family's life before and after the Holocaust. <a href = "http://www.skytingedred.com" target = "_blank">Click here</a> to learn more about the book, or <a href = "http://www.bookhousefulfillment.com/cart.php?m=product_detail&special=1&p=1200" target = "_blank">click here</a> to purchase it.

          <p class = "project-text">Children from lower-income families will hear, on average, 30-million fewer words by the time they turn four than their peers from high-income households. This vocabulary gap quickly turns into an achievement gap when these children enter school. This audio piece, about research that hopes to close the 30-million word gap, was produced with Lindsey Kratochwill for WBEZ's Front &amp; Center series on literacy in the Great Lakes region.
