        <p class = "intro">Using spreadsheets, databases and the occasional FOIA request, I tell stories on higher education using data--often about money and compensation, but also about college access, demographics and the changing academic profession.</p>

    			<h3><a href = "http://chronicle.com/article/Executive-Compensation-at/139093/#id=table" target = "_blank">What They Make: Public College Executive Compensation</a></h3>
    			<a href = "http://chronicle.com/article/Executive-Compensation-at/139093/#id=table" target = "_blank"><img class = "project-img" src = "images/exec_comp.png"></a>
    			<p class = "project-text">For this annual package, I conducted a survey of more than 200 public universities, collected and analyzed the responses, and worked with our developer and another reporter to interpret the data and present it effectively in an interactive tool. I also wrote <a href = "http://chronicle.com/article/For-Many-Public-College/139187/">a story</a> about the uncalculated benefit of housing that many college presidents receive and that neither they nor their employers pay taxes on. This project was cited widely in both national and local press.</p>

    			<p class = "project-text">This interactive feature presented readers with photos of top administrators to help them visualize the lack of diversity among Ivy League administrations. I worked with a team of reporters, editors and developers to conceive of this project, collect and sort data about administrators, and shape the final presentation.</p>

    			<p class = "project-text">For this project, a crowdsourced effort by the Chronicle of Higher Education to collect data on the salaries and working conditions of adjunct faculty across the country, I helped organize and edit the data, and worked to find and correct inconsistencies. I also analyzed the initial data for <a href = "http://chronicle.com/article/Adjunct-Project-Shows-Wide/136439/">this story</a>, which I wrote with reporter Audrey Williams June.</p>

    		<span id="writing" class="portspace"><h2>Writing</h2></span>
  			<p class = "intro">As a data journalist, I tell stories with Excel formulas and SQL queries just as often, if not more, than with words. But writing is my first passion and the skill that got me into journalism in the first place. Below are some of my favorite writing clips.</p>
  			<p class = "project">

  				<p class = "project-text">The president of the University of Washington lives rent-free and tax-free in a 12,800-square-foot, 35-room home overlooking Lake Washington. But trying to calculate the actual value of a university presidents' house is harder than it may seem. (May 12, 2013)</p>

  				<p class = "project-text">This story, written and reported for <a href = "http://www.homicidewatch.org" target = "_blank">Homicide Watch D.C.</a>, during Novemember and December 2012, was the culmination of three weeks of reporting in D.C.

  				<p class = "project-text">The story of how Minnesota, a pioneer in food co-ops and one of the first states where food swaps--monthly exchanges of homemade edibles--took root, also became the first (and so far only) state to shut them down. Published (in print!) in <a href = "http://www.thirtytwomag.com">Thirty Two Magazine</a>, a new publication on culture and ideas in the thirty-second state. (No. 3, Winter 2013)</p>

          <p class = "project-text">In April 2013, my family posthumously published my great-grandfather's chronicle of the two-and-a-half years he spent in Auschwitz-Birkenau, from April 1942 to November 1944. Written shortly after the war, translated from the original Yiddish by my grandmother decades later, and brought to publication through the efforts of several family members, <em>Sky Tinged Red</em> was truly a multigenerational project. I wrote the foreword and afterword (which you'll have to buy the book to read, detailing my family's life before and after the Holocaust.

        <span id="multimedia" class="portspace"><h2>Multimedia</h2></span>
          <p class = "intro">I can still remember my first film camera, an ugly rectangular hunk of plastic with nothing but a viewfinder and a shutter button. I walked around the house with it (usually there wasn't any film) taking photos of my family and stuffed animals (I was probably 6 years old). I've since graduated to a DSLR, but my desire to tell stories visually hasn't changed. Over the past several years I've added audio, video and even some HTML/CSS (this website was built from scratch) to my toolbox of multimedia storytelling.</p>

            <h3><a href = "http://www.wbez.org/series/front-center/falling-behind-kindergarten-30-million-word-gap-100063" target = "_blank">Falling Behind Before Kindergarten: The 30-Million Word Gap</a></h3>

            <p class = "project-text">Children from lower-income families will hear, on average, 30-million fewer words by the time they turn four than their peers from high-income households. This vocabulary gap quickly turns into an achievement gap when these children enter school. This audio piece, about research that hopes to close the 30-million word gap, was produced with Lindsey Kratochwill for WBEZ's Front &amp; Center series on literacy in the Great Lakes region.

            <p class = "project-text">Photography is not only my favorite art form, but also one of my favorite tools for engaging with the world around me and, of course, telling stories. In college, my photos were selected for three straight years for the <a href = "http://theges.org/openshutter/">Open Shutter project</a>, a student-run exhibit featuring photography that complicates, rather than simplifies, our view of the world.
